# The Biggest Land Resettlement Project in the world

All of us know that right after the partition there was a massive amount of migration that took place. There were people who came to India abandoning their homes in Pakistan and vice versa. Most of the migration that happened was based on religion, with Hindus and Sikhs coming to India and Muslims migrating to Pakistan. This migration took place across the Punjab border.

Only a few refugees had arrived before the date of transfer of power, most of them being businessmen who were farsighted enough to sell their properties in advance and migrate early with their pockets still heavy. However, the vast majority only came in after 15 August 1947 when there was eventually no choice but to either move or perish. These were farmers who were adamant about staying on their original lands if they could be assured of an honorable living in Pakistan. Though after the violence and riots that followed in September and October, they had to eventually abandon the idea and were forced to flee, if were not already killed. Unlike the businessmen, these people came with nothing but a little more than the clothes on their skin. 

Many of the Hindu and Sikhs that came from Pakistan were sent by the government of India to a refugee camp in Kurukshetra. Among around 200 camps in that area, Kurukshetra was the biggest one and had more than 300,000 people as refugees at a time. Refugee camps like Kurukshetra were just temporary holdings and the people had to be found permanent homes and productive work. As farming was the main occupation of most of the immigrants, it was quite obvious that cultivable land had to be given to the peasants. But the question is, from where would this land come? 

Well, the migration had happened on both sides. So the first place to resettle the refugees was the land vacated by Muslims in the eastern part of Punjab. However, there was a problem. Against 2.9 million hectares of land left behind by Hindus and Sikhs in Pakistan, there were only 1.9 million hectares left behind by the Muslims. Thus, India had a million hectares less land to settle the people earlier living in 3 million hectares. Just to give you an idea of how big a landmass we are talking about, let’s put these numbers into some perspective. The area of present-day Punjab is nearly 5 million hectares and the total area of vacated lands was 4.8 million hectares ( 2.9 + 1.9). Thus, it’s the area of an entire state we are talking about.

Now comes the major question which I want all of you to think about before we move forward. How do you think we divided the vacated 1.9 million hectares of land among the refugees? Ever wondered how our officials decided who would get more, who would get less and on what basis? It’s not like refugees had any proof of previous property with them. How do you think this massive problem was solved?  Well, if you are still wondering and do not have an answer, don’t worry because this is all that this article is about.

If the transfer of population had been ‘the greatest mass migration’ in history, now was to begin ‘the biggest land resettlement operation in the world’. The shortfall of a million hectare was made more acute by the fact that the areas in the west(now in Pakistan) contrary to the ones in east were more fertile, had richer soils and were abundantly irrigated. With all these odds stacked against us, let’s see how the problem was solved.

To begin with, every refugee farmer’s family was temporarily given 4 hectares of land to start the cultivation for the coming season regardless of their holdings in Pakistan. They were given loans to buy seed and equipment. Meanwhile, applications for permanent allotment were invited where each family was asked to submit how much land they had left behind. Applications were received from 10 March 1948 and within a month more than half a million claims were already filed. At this point there’s a natural question that may have come to your mind. If the families were asked to just fill the amount of land they had without any proof, wouldn’t everyone exaggerate the numbers in the application? Imagine, even if you only had a hectare of land in Pakistan before, what’s stopping you from writing that you owned an entire village spanning thousands of hectares? So,how did the officials verify the veracity of these claims?

Well, the solution was quite simple. The claims made by every family were verified in open assemblies consisting of other migrants of the same village. As every claim was read out, all the other migrants would either approve, amend, or outright reject the claim. Thus, every claim made was verified by means of a collective assembly in which no false claim could sustain. Sorry about your dream of owning an entire village. 

Like you, initially there were indeed many refugees who exaggerated the claims. However, every false claim was punished, either by a reduction in the land allotted or in extreme cases (like yours), by a brief spell of imprisonment. 

The Database of claims made, claims verified and claims given was maintained by a Rehabilitation Secretariat set up in Jalandhar. The leader of this project was Sardar Tarlok Singh, a graduate of the London School of Economics and the unsung hero who along with his team of around 7,000 officials executed this mammoth task. 

But if you have already realized, we still haven’t solved one major problem. After the verification of claims was done, we knew how much land a person had in Pakistan. But we still had a massive deficit of one million hectares. How are we supposed to account for that? Well,there’a simple solution that pops up in the minds of naive economists like us that is why not just divide the remaining land in the ratio of the claims i.e. if a person had 2.9 hectares there, just give him 1.9 here and voila! Problem solved. But as it turns out, it’s not as easy as that. Let’s think why. 

Imagine a farmer who previously had land that was just enough for his bare minimum survival, would now get even less whereas on the other hand, if a person owned a very large piece of land (village owners let’s say), would still get a very large piece; surely not as big as the previous one but still large. Also some parts of land were more fertile than others and a person who would get land in those places would be able to produce a lot more than his counterpart who was unfortunately allotted a not so fertile area. So I think now you have started to get the feeling of the associated problems and that there is some sort of normalization required to ensure that everyone gets a fair share. This is where the excellence of Tarlok Singh stepped in. 

Tarlok Singh used his academic training to excellent effect and proposed the ideas of what he called as the ‘standard acre’ and the ‘graded cut’. A ‘standard acre’ was defined as the amount of land which could yield ten to eleven maunds of rice. ( A maund is about 40 kgs). In dry and unirrigated areas, four physical acres made up one standard acre whereas, in the lush and fertile canal colonies, one physical acre of land approximately equaled to a standard one. This idea of standard acre efficiently took care of the variations in soil and climate across the province.

‘Graded cut’ on the other hand helped to cut down the massive shortage of land, the shortage that was close to a million hectares. In graded cut, for the first 10 acres of any claim, a cut of 25 percent was implemented that is, if you made a verified claim of 10 acres, you would only get 7.5 acres. A 30 percent cut for 10 - 30 acres and so on. As the claim went higher, so does the cuts till those having in excess of 500 acres were ‘taxed’ at 95 percent.

It worked great for small peasants but turned out in a real nightmare for large landowners. One greatest example, was a lady named Vidyawati, who had inherited her husband’s estate of 11,500 acres spread across 35 villages in Pakistan. After the graded cut, she was allotted a mere 835 acres in a single village of Karnal. Just to put these numbers into perspective, the area of IIT Bombay is just 600 acres. Well, now 835 acres also seem a lot right. 

So, after the graded cut was implemented, people were allotted the corresponding standard acres. This scheme helped in reducing the vast difference between the rich and the poor and led everyone to start over.  By 1950, a depopulated countryside was alive again. Attempts were made to resettle neighbors and families together, although the recreation of entire communities was impossible. 

Land resettlement was done, refugees got new land, neighborhoods were reestablished but still, a sense of loss persisted. The scars of the partition, the memories of violence and the macabre riots that ensued weren’t something that could be forgotten in a very long time. The economy was being rebuilt but the wrongs of partition could never be undone.

This would be the end of this article but there is still a question that I’m sure has popped up in your mind that I haven’t answered yet. Not everyone who came as a refugee was a farmer and not everyone had land. There were also many who were artisans, traders or labourers. What happened to them? How were they resettled? Well, this would make a topic for an entirely different article. Till then, Goodbye. Keep reading and do give your reviews.
