We always try to cherish and celebrate all the possible moments
so asto maintain a happy environment in the organization.
Festivals like Dusshehura, Diwali, Lohri, Makarsankranti, Holi and
many more are celebrated with full fledged preparation and enthusiasm.
the more we spread the more we spread , the more we get, so the
celebrations are kept open for all the people of insti who in turn
always participate with full zest. Also, a DJ night is organised on
the last day of ATC, where cadets from several other several other
colleges also celebrate with us. Apart from this, we are always an
