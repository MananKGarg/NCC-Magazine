As we celebrate , we allows the stresses of life to fall behind and spend our time doing the things we love with the people we love . Keeping this in mind , NCC IITB always try to cherish and celebrate all the possible moments so as to maintain a happy environment in the organization. Festivals like Dusshehura, Diwali, Lohri, Makarsankranti, Holi and many more are celebrated with full fledged preparation and enthusiasm. The more we spread , the more we get . So the celebrations are kept open for all the people of insti who in turn always participate with full zest. Also, a DJ night is organised on the last day of ATC, where cadets from several colleges also celebrate with us. The best thing about these celebrations is that they make lives richer and more full by allowing us to relax and unwind .
