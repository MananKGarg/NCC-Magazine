In order to bring a change, it is not enough to just be compassionate, it is imperative to act. Quite aware of this fact, At NCC IITB, we collectively contribute for social welfare by volunteering in various independently organised events as well as the ones organised by Abhyuday, the social body of IIT Bombay. This year, we volunteered in CCC by Abhyuday providing Career Counseling to the underprivileged kids of govt schools of Mumbai, participated in clean campus initiative as a part of Clean India Drive and independently organised a an institutewide donation drive at the time of Diwali which helped bring smiles on the faces of numerous forsaken children of Mumbai.
