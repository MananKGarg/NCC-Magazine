Whether it be a challenging trek to the highest peak of Maharashtra, a lively day with water sports at a sunkissed beach or just a 30 km cycling trip to the Marine Drive, NCC IITB makes sure that the oozing wanderlust inside all is aptly fulfilled throughout the year. Two official trips, one per semester are organised  along with numerous informal ones.
