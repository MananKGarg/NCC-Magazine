## MANAN 1

Whether it be a challenging trek to the highest peak of Maharashtra, a lively day with water sports at a sunkissed beach or just a 30 km cycling trip to the Marine Drive, NCC IITB makes sure that the oozing wanderlust inside all the exuberant freshmen is aptly satisfied throughout the year. Two official trips, one per semester along with numerous informal ones are planned and organised by the Adventure Council consisting of an Adventure Head and an Adventure Secretary. Along with being great escapades from grueling academics schedules, these trips also serve as the platforms for strengthening of budding friendships which from there may even last a lifetime!
