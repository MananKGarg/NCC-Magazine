# <p align = 'center' > We Salute </p>

 " A thoughtful mind when it sees a nation's flag , sees not the flag, but the nation itself. "- Henry Ward Beecher

Providing with the rarest of rare opportunities to its cadets is a tradition in NCC IITB . Saluting the nation's flag is one of them.
NCC IITB bestows this providential opportunity to its cadets twice in a year : first on the occasion of Independence Day and then on 
the Republic Day. Apart from saluting the flag , the cadets get a chance to give much respected and coveted Guard of Honour to the
higher rank officers of defence forces and other dignitaries coming for special days in NCC or some events in insti . Republic Day
celebration is one of the grandest and venerable event of the organization for which cadets practice for almost a month with full
fervour and devotion . When they pass by the flag , with uniform and ceremonials put on , the heartbeats synchronize with the beats
of the march past, the salute becoming a reflex and eyes of the audience on them.....
Nothing can feel better and more satisfactory !!!
