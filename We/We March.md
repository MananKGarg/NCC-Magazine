Foot Drill is the part and parcel of every NCC unit. It inculcates a sense of discipline among cadets and develops the quality of immediate obedience to orders. At NCC IITB, students are trained in drills by their seniors in sessions that take place once a week. In these sessions, cadets put in a lot of effort to learn about the proper execution of commands that involve intricate technique and synchronized movements. All the hard work churns out brilliant contingents that march in one of the grandest events in the Institute, the Republic Day Parade. Several other opportunities like the Training GC are provided where cadets can display their marching skills. Apart from this, foot drill carries a high weightage in the evaluation of cadets for captain selection and rank determination.
