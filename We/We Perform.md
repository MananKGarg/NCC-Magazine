# We Perform

**“The Earth Is My Stage And The Sun Is My Spotlight”   ― Joshua Teya**

The performing arts are a great way of developing confidence, resilience, and bonding among students. In our unit, they play a vital role in the progress of a cadet. Every year, the three companies compete in the Cultural GC, wherein cadets from each company perform dance, music, and theatre. The GC is an amazing opportunity for students to be creative, and to explore the genres of their interest. Apart from this, a cultural event is organized in ATC to encourage cadets from all the companies to perform together. This event also witnesses participation from other colleges. All these events are conducted by the Cultural Council of NCC IIT Bombay. The Council comprises of a Head and a couple of Secretaries, who work together for planning and managing all the cultural events.
