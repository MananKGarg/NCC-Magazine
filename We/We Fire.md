Using firearms(for non harming<mark>good word</mark> purposes obvoiusly!) is a thrilling luxury that isn't quite affordable for any general college student, but for NCC cadets, it is just one of the many perks of being a part of the organisation. During the Annual Training Camp, all the cadets are trained in properly holding and using a 0.22 mm Sporting Rifle.
