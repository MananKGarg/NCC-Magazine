Competition is the real world and those who have talent or work the hardest , become successful . Competitions in IIT are inevitable 
and competition for IITians is inseparable !!! Here too , at NCC IIT Bombay competitions are integral part . Various GCs are
organized like Cult GC, Sports GC and Training GC throughout the year which keep cadets sufficiently involved to learn and grow new
potentialities and skills. Several informal competitions like Battle of Companies, Tug of War, Debates etc. are also organized so as
to make competitions more extensive, substantial and increase the bonding among cadets at the same time. During ATC , cadets compete 
in cult , sports and training with students of other colleges as well which is quite a rare opportunity for other students in insti
until and unless they are selected for Aavhan or inter IITs . NCC IITB provide an ample number of opportunities to the cadets so as to
groom their personality comprehensively .
