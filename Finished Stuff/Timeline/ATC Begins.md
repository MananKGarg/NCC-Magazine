## ATC Begins

On 27 Novemeber 2019, we began with the Combined Annual Training Camp (CATC - 411), the camp that comprises of
the most Exhilarating, Adventurous and fun-filled 10 days of the year at NCC IITB.  More than 300
students from IIT Bombay, DY Patil College of Engineering, MTES Doshi Vakil College, Atomic
Energy Central School and Campus School, IIT Bombay took part in the training camp.

Students from these schools and colleges stayed in the IIT campus and 
competed in different sports, drills and cultural activities to fight for the glory of their respective
institutions. Who won? Well, this the matter we'll be taking up after sometime.

This camp was no doubt an onerous challenge but was also a great learning opportunity for all the
cadets. It was probably also the time when most of the IITB freshmen made strong friendships and best memories of their freshie year. If you are an NCC cadet reading this, quickly turn over because you are gonna find a lot of relatable moments ahead.
