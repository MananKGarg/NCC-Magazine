The much awaited camp of NCC IIT Bombay , the annual training camp began with high enthusiasm and excitement among the cadets . The ten-days camp was attended by cadets of many
colleges like DY Patil College , Doshi Vakil College ,IIT Bombay , KV Campus School and AECS Tarapur . On the very first day of the camp , the cadets participated in a career
counselling campaign . The campaign was organised in association with Abhyuday , the social body of IIT Bombay . With the aim of mentoring and guiding the school students about
the prodigious career opportunities available in various streams and fields of profession , the cadets visited various schools across the city . The students were also given a
brief insight about streams like science , commerce and arts .  Also the cadets tried to break some myths regarding the same . Apart from career guidance , they also motivated
the school students to follow their dreams and passion fervently . After this campaign , all cadets gathered in the NCC area and then were briefed about the schedule of the camp and many upcoming events .
