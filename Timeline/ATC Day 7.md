# ATC Day 7 :

Seventh day also  began with the same enthusiasm and excitement among the cadets . After the regular morning physical training session , Swachh Bharat Drive was organized as a part of social service . During the drive , cadets not only cleaned the NCC area and the newly built obstacle ground , broomed the nearby streets , picked up littered garbage but also tried to create awareness about the importance of cleanliness and proper hygiene . The drive was followed by a thought-provoking lecture on Pollution and Pollutants in Nature . After that , there was really an exhilarating competition of Girls’ Kho-Kho in which eventually Doshi Vakil won the Champions title by defeating both IIT Bombay and DY Patil college . Same was the case with Boys’ Volleyball as well wherein again IIT Bombay won after a series of tough and close matches . In Boys’ Athletics , IIT Bombay won gold and silver medals in 100m category and gold in 4x100m relay race respectively . In 1600m , Gold medal was bagged by Doshi Vakil College followed by silver medal by IIT Bombay . After all these relishing trounces , at the time of Roll Call , the cadets were briefed about the next day’s schedule after having some time of an informal interaction with the seniors.
