# ATC Day 7 :

After the regular morning physical training session , Swachh Bharat Drive was organized as a part of social service . During this drive , cadets not only cleaned the NCC area 
along with the newly built obstacle ground , broomed the nearby streets , picked up littered garbage but also tried to create awareness about the importance of cleanliness and 
proper hygiene . This cleanliness drive was followed by a thought-provoking lecture on Pollution and Pollutants in Nature . After that , there was a Girls’ Kho-Kho competition 
which was really an exhilarating competition and eventually Doshi Vakil won the Champions title by defeating both IIT Bombay and DY Patil college . There was the same case with
Boys’ Volleyball wherein too IIT Bombay won after a series of tough and close matches . In Boys’ Athletics , IIT Bombay won gold and silver medals in 100m category and gold in
