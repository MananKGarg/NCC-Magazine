## ATC Begins

Here we begin with the Combined Annual Training Camp (CATC - 411), the camp that comprises of
the most Exhilarating, Adventurous and fun-filled 10 days of the year in NCC. More than 300
students from IIT Bombay, DY Patil College of Engineering, MTES Doshi Vakil College, Atomic
Energy Central School and Campus School, IIT Bombay are taking part in this camp.
Students from these colleges and Schools would be staying in the IIT campus and would also
