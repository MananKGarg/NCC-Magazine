# ATC Day 9 :

Embellished with the beautiful ceremonials , smartly dressed in fresh and proper uniforms , holding rifles in their strong hands and having pride in their glistening eyes , on
the penultimate day of the camp , all of us espied the guards of IIT Bombay standing to welcome and pay respect to the Chief Guest of the day , Brigadier Gagandeep Singh Cheema .
The Brigadier was feted by the pilots on his arrival who then went to take an honour from the guards of IIT Bombay . After an awe-inspiring show , the Brigadier appreciated the
guards and admirably said , “ This was one of the best Guard of Honour I have witnessed till now ....” . This was followed by the Prize Distribution Ceremony wherein the winners
of the various sports events were felicitated with medals , trophies and merit certificates . In the day-time after lunch , a cultural programme was organized in LT-PCSA in which
cadets from all the colleges participated and many mind-blowing performances in Dance , Music and Dramatics were manifested by them . Meanwhile Blood Donation camp was organized
in the NCC area , wherein many cadets voluntarily donated blood , keeping the sense of awareness in donating blood and the responsibility towards society , in their mind. The 
long , amusing day ended with a fun-filled DJ night and Bonfire in the NCC area where everyone danced their hearts out .
