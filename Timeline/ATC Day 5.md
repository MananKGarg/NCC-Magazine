The fifth day began with Yoga in the early morning session . The germane session was organized for the half of the cadets to emphasize the importance of Yoga in our
bustling life , in which they were taught to concentrate better and to avail Yoga in a spiritual way . The Yoga session was followed by an Intercollege Debate Competition 
on the topic of ‘Militancy and Terrorism can be stopped by observing Human Rights’ in the morning session . The competition was an exquisite one as so many great ideas and
different spiffing viewpoints were put forward by the cadets of different colleges . The competition was followed by an applaudable lecture by the esteemed IRS officer Reshma
Lakhani in which she briefed the cadets about the career opportunities available to them in civil services. She also accentuated the point that how they can become the best
version of themselves by opting a career in the same . In the girl’s Volleyball competition , everyone got to see some really close and gripping matches . Eventually the team 
from IIT Bombay won against both DY Patil and Doshi Vakil College . Boys kho-kho consisted of the most breathtaking competitions of the day , in which Doshi Vakil College defeated
DY Patil College while IIT Bombay skunked both of them in a series of really exciting matches wherein we saw excellent performances by Rangaswami Rathode and Srijan Bansal.
