# ATC Day 10 :

"...All good things shall come to an end and so does this camp but what matters is what we take back with us", said Commanding Officer Colonel AS Mehta during his closing address
of ATC on the last day, the day 10. In his warm and encouraging address, he motivated cadets to always be disciplined and united and to take some positive takeaways from the
camp. After CO Sirâ€™s address, a felicitation ceremony was organised in which PI staff members and the council members of NCC IIT Bombay were honoured for organising a ten-days 
long camp consisting of hundreds of cadets. They were appreciated for smoothly conducting the whole camp and providing cadets one of the most beautiful memories of their lives. 
After the ceremony, all the cadets bade farewell to each other, to the life-long friends they made in the camp and to the unforgettable memories and experiences they made with them.
