# Lohri

Lohri, a festival which officially marks the end of winters and the onset of Spring, the season of new beginnings ! Keeping the
tradition of celebrating festivals together, NCC IITB organized Lohri celebrations in NCC area. The event began with the lighting
the bonfire, doing some worships and prayers according to rituals which created a positive ambience in the area. Soon enough number
of people gathered to celebrate the festival in an efficacious way. Soon after the worship was completed, DJs were all set to fire 
the event with joy and energy. Some around the bonfire, some in their own groups and some individually started dancing in their own 
way. Soon jubilation surrounded the NCC grounds completely in the form of dance. There was a photo session going on simultaneously 
where everyone wanted to capture the memories of the night and get their future DPs ready in their stunning and striking traditional
looks. Exhausted after dancing to the fullest in the DJ night, everyone sat surrounding the bonfire to participate in some more joyful
activities. Various games were played and songs were sung by some, which made the aura quite euphonious, enough to end the celebration
in a quite charming way.
