#  ATC Day 2 

After the pre-eminent start of the camp on the first day, the second day began with a power packed and motivational lecture
by the commanding officer colonel A.S. Mehta. He introduced the camp to the cadets and informed them about the activities which
will be performed during the camp. The cadets were assured that this is going to be the one of the best experiences of their life.
Also, instructions about dos and donâ€™ts in the camp were given. The speech successfully made a positive impact on the cadets and
created a very comfortable environment from the very beginning of the camp. Later on, another noteworthy lecture was given by V.M.
Gadre, a much esteemed professor of the institute whose oration acted as a cherry on the cake after the sermonizing speech by the
CO Sir. Being quite an interactive lecture, the cadets enjoyed it thoroughly and participated enthusiastically in all the activities
given by him. The irrepressible applaud by the cadets in the end said it all about his outstanding lecture of the day. In sports,
cricket tournament was organized between the three colleges: IIT, DY Patil and Doshi Vakeel College. Both IIT and DY Patil won
against Doshi Vakeel in their first match. DY Patil emerged as the overall winner after defeating the iit boys in a nail biting
finale between the two robust teams. And the joyous day finished off with the roll call, sufficiently charging and exciting the
cadets for the thrill to come in upcoming days.
