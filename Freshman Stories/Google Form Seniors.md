## Oh, the memories we made. Oh, the stories we have !!

Hey guys,

For most of us, the time we spent in NCC was undoubtedly the best part of our freshie year. The morning when we proudly marched together on Republic Day, the afternoons when we played together in ATC, the nights we all danced together would surely remain in our hearts forever. I'm sure all of us remember the festivals, the final day of ATC as well as the last session, where our faces were lit but hearts were heavy. And who remembers that there was a bug in the code? 

We danced our hearts out in the celebrations, We made friendships that may as well last a lifetime and we made memories that really make us want to go back to that time.

Now, we cannot go back in time, but we can certainly cherish the sweet memories we made being a part of this organization. In order to collect these sweet memories and always remember the time we had as NCC cadets, we are making a yearbook that would contain everything we did in the past year.

But this yearbook would be incomplete without your contributions, your stories. We are floating this form to know what you feel about your time in NCC, your experiences, your funny incidents, your proud moments. So just take a trip down the memory lane, scroll up your galleries, relive those moments, and see if you can share with us a part of your journey. We will accommodate these in the yearbook.

You can - 

1.  Share some good photos you have. 
2.  Share stories/incidents.
3.  Write senti paragraphs.
4.  Tell about any personal development you feel in yourself because of NCC.
5.  Share an incident with a related photograph.
6.  Any other stuff you would like to contribute (like your friend's silly photo).

Your incidents/experience and photos can be related to anything. 
If you face any difficulty or you are doubtful about sending something, feel free to contact us.

We eagerly await your response.
