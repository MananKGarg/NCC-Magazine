# What was Operation Blue Star? Who killed Indira Gandhi and Why?

I’m sure a lot of us have some idea that Indira Gandhi, our first woman Prime Minister was brutally assassinated while going to her office on a fine October morning. But why was she assassinated is a question, the answer to which is not so easily understandable without putting a proper context to the events that occurred. This article is my attempt to consolidate the events that led to all the related mishaps and informl you all about it in a short 15 min read. Let’s begin

So, that one flutter of the butterfly that would eventually cause all the catastrophic events nearly 18 years later was the formation of New Punjab in 1966, the one we know today. Punjab before 1966, was a state that comprised of present-day Punjab, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh. The main force responsible for this partition was the Akali Dal, the major Sikh Political Party and the first character of our story. Akali Dal wanted a state with a Sikh majority or as they called it ‘a Sikh Nation ’. They were successful in their goal to form a new Punjab but even after that, to their utter dismay, they weren’t quite able to authoritatively ‘rule’ the state. This is because in 1967 as well as 1969, they had to form unstable coalitions with ‘Hindu’  Parties whereas in 1971, their arch enemy, the Congress came to power in Punjab on its own, thanks to the vast pan India campaigns by Indira Gandhi,the then Prime Minister of the country and the second but most important character of our story. Naturally, Akali Dal was unhappy in the times after 1971. 

Now let’s take a leap and come to 1977. India had been in a state of ‘Emergency’ for 21 months from June 1975 to March 1977. Why was the emergency declared? This would need an entirely different article to explain but for now, let’s just fast forward this period and come to what happened after it. So, after the emergency was lifted in 1977, elections were held and Congress lost, both at the center and in Punjab. The Akalis were now in Power. 

The third character of our story are the Nirankaris. Nirankaris were a sect that thought of themselves as Sikhs but believed in a living human Guru. The italicized human is significant here because in general, Sikhs believe that there had to be only ten human gurus and after Guru Gobind Singh, the tenth Guru, all the holy knowledge was passed into the Guru Granth Sahib, the holy Sikh scripture, which now serves as their eternal Guru. 

In April 1978, Nirankaris were to have a large convention at Amritsar. Leading the opposition to Nirankari was a hitherto not very well known preacher Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, the fourth character of our story. Bhindranwale had years ago left his wife and kids to become head of a seminary called Damdami Taksal. He had an impressive personality: over six feet tall, slim, athletic had abysmal eyes and wore a long navy blue robe. He believed the Sikhs were being discriminated in India by Hindus and demanded Sikh purity in the state. There are theories that Bhindranwale was originally a puppet put in position by Sanjay Gandhi(Son of Indira Gandhi) and the then Union Home Minister Zail Singh as a measure to counter the Akali Dal. Yet again, the italicized word in the previous line is significant because before Sanjay Gandhi and Zail Singh realized, Bhindranwale was out of their hands. We will soon see why.

I told you that Nirankaris were to have a large convention at Amritsar. Bhindranwale knew about it and when the convention was in progress, Bhindranwale angrily preached his followers against the Nirankaris who then went on to attack the convention. Nirankaris fought back and in the battle that ensued, fifteen people died. This was in 1978.

A year back in 1977 Congress had lost the General Elections. So who won them? Janta Sangh was the party which along with multiple coalitions barely managed to grab hold of the center. However, within two and a half years only, the party started to lose support and coalition partners started to back out resulting in a condition of no majority and as a result, there were re-elections called in 1980. In 1980, Congress under the leadership of Indira Gandhi, again took hold of both, the center and Punjab. This was a severe blow to the Akali Sikh Pride and as a result, the agitated Akalis who were now out of power chose to take the path of confrontation. 

Now enters our fifth character of the story, Sant Harcharan Singh Longowal, the new leader of Akalis after the 1980 elections. Longowal, like Bhindranwale, also stationed himself in the Golden Temple and would from inside announce street protests on various typical Akali demands. Bhindranwale meanwhile acquired a large group of armed followers who acted as his bodyguards and on occasions, as willing and unpaid killers.

In April 1980, the Nirankari leader Baba Gurcharan Singh was shot dead in New Delhi. It was believed that Bhindranwale was behind the killing but no action was taken. In 1981, Lala Jagat Narain, a famous editor who proactively wrote about the wrongness of Sikh extremism and the preachers of this ideology (guess who he was writing about), was also murdered by Bhindranwale’s men. This time a warrant was issued against him but Home Minister Zail Singh did not let the arrest happen, apparently worried about the public anger that would ensue. However, Bhindranwale had a completely different plan in his mind.

Bhindranwale sent out the word that he would willingly surrender, but only if he was arrested by Sikh policeman with beards and that he would choose the time of arrest. Surprisingly, Punjab government agreed to these humiliating terms. Well, the terms might not seem that humiliating at first but just think about it for a minute, one man who is accused of murder is choosing the time of his arrest and also the people who would arrest him. Think what message this sends about the power of govt, but more so, about the power of that one man. Two weeks later, Bhindranwale turned himself in only to be released three weeks later due to lack of evidence. Many people define his release as the ‘turning point’ of his career because he was now seen as a hero who had challenged and defeated the Indian Government. He had transformed himself from a murder suspect to a political force.

Bhindranwale considered Sikhs as a different entity and aspired autonomy for Punjab. Throughout 1982 and 1983, there were many violent acts against Hindus in the state which forced them to flee. In one particular incident in 1983, terrorists stopped a bus on a highway, segregated the Hindus, and shot them all. Communal violence between Hindus and Sikhs was an unprecedented situation for the nation and was something nobody had thought would ever happen. But by 1984, conflicts in Punjab grew and attacks on Hindus were happening every now and then. 

So that was all the background we needed and as you can see we have now arrived in 1984, the year Operation Bluestar took place. 

Bhindranwale seated himself on the Akal Takht, a building in the Golden temple that historically served as the seat of religious authority. It was the Akal Takht from where the Gurus would issue their order, orders that all Sikhs were obliged to follow, and honor. In 1984, Bhindranwale began to fortify the Golden Temple under the supervision of Former Major General Shubeg Singh, a hero of the 1971 war. Shubeg Singh was also the person who had trained Mukti Bahini, the Bangladeshi forces who fought in 1971. The fortification was done because an attack by the government was quite anticipated, however, the main thought behind this was not to fight the military but to hold them long enough to cause an uprising among all the Sikhs who would then collectively march towards the Golden Temple against the military. Why would Sikhs go against the military? Remember what the battleground is, the Golden Temple itself. Imagine the reaction of people getting to know that the military is killing their people and that too inside their holiest shrine. 

The Indian Military, on the other hand, was lead by Major General R.S. Brar, a student of Shubeg Singh. Ironical right, but it’s not like the first time the world has seen teachers against their students, rang some bells?

The Akali Dal was also getting more militant. Longowal had announced that on 3 june, they would stop the passage of the grains outside the state but that didn’t happen. You’ll soon know why.

Seeing the situation get out of control, the Prime Minister decided that militants had to be removed from the Golden Temple. Brar was asked to plan and execute what was being called ‘Operation Bluestar’. He had to remove the militants from the Golden temple with minimum loss of life and damage to the temple. He was asked to finish the mission in 48 hours, if possible.

On 2 June, a Sikh officer, posed as a pilgrim, entered the Golden temple and walked around for over an hour to analyze the preparations done by Bhindranwale’s men for their defense. On 4th June, there was irregular firing in the temple’s outer walls as the army tried to hold control of towers occupied by militants. Pilgrims were repeatedly asked to leave the temple by the means of announcements done by the army. Yes, there were pilgrims inside who had no relation to either Bhindranwale or the army. It is said that Bhindranwale’s men did not let them out at that time and used them as human shield. On the night of 5th June, the attack was finally launched. Brar estimated that they would get hold of the Akal Takht by noon the next day, however, he grossly underestimated the number of militants, their firearms, their training, and their resolve. With their knowledge of narrow passages and verandahs, they were able to launch lethal surprise attacks on the advancing troops.

By early morning of 6th, Brar wasn’t able to get inside. Finally, permission from Delhi was granted to use tanks to break the defence. By dawn, several tanks ranging somewhere between 5 and 13 in number broke through the temple’s gates and rained fire inside for the whole day until it was deemed safe for the troops to enter.

Shubeg Singh and Bhindranwale were found dead in the basement with Singh still holding his walkie talkie in one hand. 

The death toll by the government was estimated at 4 officers, 79 soldiers and 492 militants. However, many other unofficial estimations say that as much as 3000 people were killed, many of these being pilgrims caught in the crossfire.

At this point, I would like to quote the words of R.S. Brar after the attack, ‘Notwithstanding the fact that by converting the House of God into a battlefield, all the principles of the ten Gurus were thrown overboard. It must be admitted that the tenacity with which the militants held their ground, the stubborn valor with which they fought the battle and the high degree of confidence displayed by them merits praise and recognition’. Being a Sikh himself, we can not even completely imagine the pain Brar might have gone through in leading this operation. But that is I guess what Indian Army is, strong when they need to be, always placing duty before anyone else.

Operation Bluestar left a deep scar in the minds of Sikhs who condemned the actions of Prime Minister. Sikhs who were against Bhindranwale too started to believe in him. However, outside Punjab, Indira Gandhi’s firm actions against the terrorists were duly praised. After the operation, intelligence agencies advised the Prime Minister to change her Sikh bodyguards but she rejected the advice by saying, ‘Aren’t we secular?’. She did not know that rejecting this advice would be the greatest mistake of her life or we can say, the greatest mistake for her life.

At 9:30 AM on 31st October, Indira Gandhi while going to her office, was shot by her bodyguards Beant Singh and Satwant Singh. Beant Singh shot three bullets from his revolver whereas Satwant Singh fired 30 bullets from his submachine gun out of which 27 hit her.Her bodyguards had returned from a visit home and had been fueled by anger against the happenings of Operation Bluestar. She succumbed to the injuries given to her by the 30 bullets that hit her that day..

Indira Gandhi’s assassination led to retaliatory violence against Sikhs all over the country. Thousands of Sikhs were brutally killed in the aftermath. What happened after this? How did the country eventually cope up? How was peace restored? This would be a topic of another article. 

Right now, it is important for us to realize that in this conflict, there were no winners. The operation, although successful, only increased the horrific incidents across the country. The one key lesson is that political parties should never play with religious sentiments and religious leaders should never misuse places of worship. We, as responsible citizens should realize if this kind of situation arises, and act accordingly because being impulsive in these matters, can be really dangerous.

Despite of history trying to teach it all to us, we still see the same things happening, parties change, religions change, people change but the issue remains the same. It’s important that we stop the fire before it gets too big.

That is all for today, The article stretched much longer than I expected, thanks for reading and do comment your views in the comment box.
